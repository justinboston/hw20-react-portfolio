      <p>Hello, my name is Justin! I live in Hoboken, New Jersey which is right across the river from New York City. I currently work in NYC as a Product Manager at a news publication. My coding experience is limited to what I've come across on the job, which includes editing basic HTML elements on webpages, copy/pasting SQL queries & some debugging of mobile & connected tv applications. I am taking the full stack development course not only to help me in my current job but also to hopefully gain enough coding experience to transition into a more technical role. For fun, I like to watch & play sports. Formerly a competitive baseball player but now I just play basketball & softball recreationally. Please find a few examples of my dev work below.</p>
